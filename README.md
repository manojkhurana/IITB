# IITB-PGD-Gesture_Recognition
Problem : Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.
This repository contains python notebook where different experiments are done using Conv3D, CNN+RNN (with and without transfer learning) models with different hyper parameters to get best optimized model to recognize gestures
There is a word file explaining the approach to get the best model to recognize teh gestures
h5 file having best model achieved with optimized parameters is also includes
